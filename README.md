# Proxy Objects + Bonus: BEM

## Repo with slides and code sample for a talk for [BogotaJS](https://www.meetup.com/BogotaJS/?_locale=es-ES)

Proxy objects came with EcmaScript 6 and they are a handy way to intercep the regular behavarior of an object, even changing methods that haven't even been created!

This talk is provided thanks to the BogotaJS team, [WesBos](https://github.com/wesbos) incredible ES6 for Everyone course and this [DailyJS Article](https://medium.com/dailyjs/how-to-use-javascript-proxies-for-fun-and-profit-365579d4a9f8)

Check out the [slides](http://slides.com/nikodermus/bogotajs-proxies/) for deeper follow through

## Content
\# | Folder | Content
--- | --- | ---
01 | Structure | Basic example for making your own Proxy Object and what a handler is and how it can be used
02 | Phone Proxy | Phone numbers can be tricky to work with, what about if we just fix them before the even are stored within an object
03 | Proxi API | Handling dummy mistakes can make your own API so powerfull, there's not even need to modify just wrap what you already had!
04 | API Methods | Get a NODE API running with only one getter method, leave all the rest to the Proxy Handler
05 | Tricky Question | Can `(data.a === 1 && data.a === 2 && data.a === 3)` return true? It can! See here how
